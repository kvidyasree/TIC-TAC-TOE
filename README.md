# TIC-TAC-TOE
Tic Tac Toe is a zero-sum and perfect information game. It means that each participant's gain is equal to the other participants' losses.
The purpose of the game is to make players to arrange their marks (O, X) in such a way that they form a continuous line of three cells, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. 
By preventing the opponent's line from being completed, an opponent can prevent a win. Players put noughts and crosses on a board in our version of the game.
